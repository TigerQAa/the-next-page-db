The Next Page is a website to find peer reviews on books. This is the search part of The Next Page. This README will explain the tech stack and how the project works. This is currently a WIP until most of the website is finished.

# Svelte/Sveltekit

Svelte is a Javascript Framework. A framework has prebuilt libraries, components, and API to create a website easily. You can learn Svelte [here](https://learn.svelte.dev). (You don't need to learn Part 2 if you don't want to.)

SvelteKit is a framework that combines serverside and clientside code in one place with Svelte. It is similar to Next.js. If you don't know SvelteKit but know Svelte, skip to Part 3 at https://learn.svelte.dev.
